	<p>When it comes to studying, some students work better when in a group. However, not all students have the resources to find their own study groups. Study Hall allows students to find other students to study with. Using a similar type of matching system as Tinder, students enter information including graduation year, class schedule, and major. After receiving matches, students are able chose whether or not they want to study with the student. This is a simple, unique, and fun way for people with similar focuses to find each other and get to work.</p>
